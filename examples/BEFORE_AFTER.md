# Before & After Comparison

Real scenarios showing what changes when you use the analytics-workspace.

---

## Scenario 1: Building a Customer Dashboard

### Before (Without Framework)

**8:00 AM** - Product manager asks for customer churn dashboard

**8:15 AM** - Search Slack for "how did we do that revenue dashboard last month?"

**8:30 AM** - Find old dashboard, open 5 browser tabs (dbt repo, Tableau, Snowflake console, last project's notes, Google doc with requirements)

**9:00 AM** - Context-switch to dbt repository, try to remember branch naming convention

**9:15 AM** - Start writing dbt model, forget if we use incremental models or tables for BI

**10:00 AM** - Google "dbt incremental model best practices" (again)

**10:30 AM** - Write model, forget to add tests

**11:00 AM** - Model runs, but takes 45 minutes. Try to optimize.

**11:45 AM** - Realize I should have clustered the table. Rebuild.

**1:00 PM** - Lunch

**2:00 PM** - Build Tableau dashboard, can't remember how we set up the last one

**2:30 PM** - Ask teammate "what was that filter pattern we used for date ranges?"

**3:00 PM** - Dashboard works! Forget to document what I did.

**3:15 PM** - Commit to dbt repo with message "fix dashboard"

**3:30 PM** - Realize I should have created a PR. Create PR manually with minimal description.

**Total time:** 6+ hours over a full workday
**Knowledge captured:** None (will need to re-figure this out next time)
**Context switches:** 12+ times

### After (With Framework)

**8:00 AM** - Product manager asks for customer churn dashboard

**8:05 AM** - Run command:
```bash
claude /start "customer churn dashboard"
```

Framework creates:
- Project folder: `projects/active/feature-customer-churn-dashboard/`
- Git branch: `feature/customer-churn-dashboard`
- Documentation templates: spec.md, context.md, README.md
- Task tracking structure

**8:10 AM** - Ask Claude:
```
"Use analytics-engineer-role to design a customer churn model similar to our revenue dashboard"
```

**8:18 AM** - Get complete dbt model design from agents:
- analytics-engineer-role remembered revenue dashboard patterns
- dbt-expert provided incremental model with clustering
- Included test suite
- Optimized for Tableau performance (learned from past projects)

**8:25 AM** - Implement the SQL (copy-paste from agent output, adjust for our data)

**8:40 AM** - Run model, works on first try with tests passing

**9:00 AM** - Ask Claude:
```
"Use tableau-expert to design dashboard layout"
```

**9:10 AM** - Get dashboard design matching our style guide (agents learned company patterns)

**10:00 AM** - Build dashboard in Tableau

**10:30 AM** - Dashboard complete!

**10:35 AM** - Run:
```bash
claude /complete feature-customer-churn-dashboard
```

Framework automatically:
- Archives project documentation
- Extracts patterns for future churn dashboards
- Closes GitHub issue
- Prompts for PR creation

**Total time:** 2.5 hours
**Knowledge captured:** Automatic (churn model pattern now in agent memory)
**Context switches:** 0 (everything coordinated in one place)

**Time saved:** 3.5 hours on this project
**Future impact:** Next churn dashboard will be even faster (agents learned the pattern)

---

## Scenario 2: Onboarding a New Team Member

### Before (Without Framework)

**Week 1:**
- Read 50-page Confluence wiki (half of it outdated)
- Ask teammates "how do we do X?" 20+ times
- Interrupt senior engineers for context

**Week 2:**
- Build first dbt model, use wrong naming convention
- Forget tests, PR gets rejected
- Don't know about incremental model patterns

**Week 3:**
- Ask "didn't we build something like this before?"
- Senior engineer spends 30 min explaining old project from memory

**Week 4:**
- Still not productive without constant guidance

**Total onboarding time:** 4-6 weeks to full productivity

---

### After (With Framework)

**Day 1:**
- Clone framework repository
- Run `./setup.sh` with team's tech stack
- Agents already know company patterns (from completed projects)

**Day 2:**
- Start first project: `claude /start "simple dashboard"`
- Ask agents: "Show me how we structure staging models"
- Get exact patterns used by the team (from agent memory)

**Day 3:**
- Implement following agent guidance
- Tests pass on first try (agents know team standards)
- PR gets approved quickly (code matches established patterns)

**Week 2:**
- Fully productive
- Agents answer 80% of questions
- Only ask teammates for business context

**Total onboarding time:** 1-2 weeks to full productivity

**Senior engineer time saved:** 10+ hours (no need to explain patterns repeatedly)

---

## Scenario 3: "I built this 6 months ago, how did I do it?"

### Before (Without Framework)

1. Search Slack for old messages (nothing useful)
2. Look through git history (`git log --grep "something maybe related"`)
3. Find old PR, try to understand from diff
4. Old code has no comments
5. Original teammate who built it left the company
6. Spend 2 hours reconstructing the approach
7. Still not sure if this is the best way

**Result:** Re-implement from scratch, possibly worse than the original

---

### After (With Framework)

1. Ask Claude: "How did we build the customer segmentation model?"
2. Agent responds with exact pattern from completed project:
   - Original requirements
   - dbt model design with reasoning
   - Performance optimizations applied
   - Tests that were used
   - Why specific decisions were made

**Result:** Reuse proven pattern in 5 minutes

---

## Scenario 4: Multi-Repo Coordination

### Before (Without Framework)

**Task:** Add new customer metric (requires dbt model + Snowflake view + Tableau dashboard update)

1. Create branch in dbt repo
2. Switch to Snowflake console, create view manually
3. Forget to document the view SQL
4. Switch to Tableau repo, create new branch
5. Update dashboard
6. Commit to dbt repo
7. Context-switch to Tableau repo, commit there
8. Create 2 separate PRs
9. Reviewer asks "where's the Snowflake view definition?"
10. Scramble to find the SQL you ran

**Issues:**
- Work scattered across 3 places
- No single source of truth for the project
- Easy to forget steps
- Hard for reviewers to see complete picture

---

### After (With Framework)

**Task:** Add new customer metric

1. `claude /start "new customer lifetime value metric"`

Framework creates single project coordinating all repos:
```
projects/active/feature-customer-ltv-metric/
├── spec.md         ← Complete requirements
├── context.md      ← Current state across all repos
└── tasks/
    ├── dbt-expert-findings.md        ← Model design
    ├── snowflake-expert-findings.md  ← View definition
    └── tableau-expert-findings.md    ← Dashboard updates
```

2. Agents coordinate the work across tools
3. All SQL, definitions, decisions in one place
4. Single PR references the project folder
5. Reviewers see complete context

**Result:** Coordinated multi-repo work with full context preservation

---

## The Numbers

**Time Savings Per Project:**
- Simple dashboard: 2-3 hours saved
- Complex transformation: 4-6 hours saved
- Multi-repo coordination: 3-4 hours saved

**Team Savings (5-person team, 10 projects/month):**
- Individual time saved: ~30 hours/month per person
- Senior engineer mentoring time saved: ~15 hours/month
- Rework prevented: ~20 hours/month

**Total:** ~165 hours/month saved for a 5-person team

**That's over 4 weeks of work per month recovered.**

---

## What You Get Beyond Time Savings

**Knowledge Retention:**
- Before: Knowledge walks out the door with departing employees
- After: Patterns captured automatically in agent memory

**Consistency:**
- Before: Everyone builds things slightly differently
- After: Agents suggest proven team patterns

**Quality:**
- Before: Easy to forget tests, documentation, optimization
- After: Agents remind you of quality standards

**Onboarding:**
- Before: 6 weeks of constant questions
- After: 2 weeks with agents answering 80% of questions

**Context Switching:**
- Before: Constant mental overhead switching between tools/repos
- After: Single project coordinates everything

---

**The framework doesn't just save time - it makes your team's knowledge compound instead of evaporate.**
