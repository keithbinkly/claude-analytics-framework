# /research Command Protocol

## Purpose
Deep exploration and analysis - either before capturing an idea (pre-capture mode) or analyzing an existing GitHub issue (issue analysis mode). Enables informed decision-making through specialist agent consultation.

## Usage
```bash
# Pre-capture exploration
claude /research "topic to explore in depth"

# Existing issue analysis
claude /research <issue-number>
```

## Two Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Pre-Capture Exploration
**When to use**: You have an idea but want deep analysis before committing to capture it.

**Process**:
1. Claude analyzes the topic with relevant specialist agents
2. Explores feasibility, effort estimates, implementation approaches
3. Identifies potential challenges and alternatives
4. Presents comprehensive findings interactively
5. **Asks user**: "Should I capture this as a GitHub issue?"
   - If yes → Creates issue via `idea.sh`
   - If no → Discussion ends, no issue created

**Output**: Interactive discussion with specialist insights

**Example**:
```bash
/research "Make DA Agent Hub AI-agnostic for Codex CLI and Gemini CLI"
# → Analyzes architecture, effort, approaches
# → Presents findings
# → "Should I capture this as an issue?"
```

### Mode 2: Issue Analysis & Enhancement
**When to use**: GitHub issue exists but needs deeper technical analysis.

**Process**:
1. Fetches issue details from GitHub
2. Analyzes with relevant specialist agents
3. Adds comprehensive findings as GitHub issue comments
4. Updates issue labels based on analysis (if needed)
5. Provides effort estimates and implementation recommendations

**Output**: GitHub comment + terminal summary

**Example**:
```bash
/research 86
# → Reads issue #86
# → Analyzes with data-architect-role
# → Posts detailed findings as issue comment
```

## Agent Selection Strategy

Claude automatically selects appropriate specialist agents based on topic:

| Topic Category | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Architecture & Platform | data-architect-role | aws-expert, snowflake-expert |
| BI & Analytics | bi-developer-role | tableau-expert, business-analyst-role |
| Data Engineering | data-engineer-role | dlthub-expert, prefect-expert, orchestra-expert |
| Analytics Engineering | analytics-engineer-role | dbt-expert, snowflake-expert |
| UI/UX Development | ui-ux-developer-role | streamlit-expert, react-expert |
| Testing & Quality | qa-engineer-role | qa-coordinator |
| Cross-functional | business-context | documentation-expert |

## Claude Instructions

### Pre-Capture Mode (No Issue Number)

When user runs `/research "topic text"`:

1. **Parse topic**: Identify domain (architecture, BI, data engineering, etc.)
2. **Select agents**: Choose 1-2 most relevant specialist agents
3. **Conduct analysis**:
   - Feasibility assessment
   - Technical approach options
   - Effort estimation (complexity, timeline)
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Risk identification
   - Alternative approaches
4. **Present findings**: Comprehensive but concise summary
5. **Offer capture**: "Should I capture this as a GitHub issue?"
   - Wait for user response
   - If "yes": Run `./scripts/idea.sh "[topic]"`
   - If "no": End discussion

**Response Format**:
```
🔬 Researching: [topic]
🤖 Consulting: [agent-name]

```

### Issue Analysis Mode (Issue Number Provided)

When user runs `/research <issue-number>`:

1. **Fetch issue**: `gh issue view <issue-number> --json title,body,labels`
2. **Parse content**: Extract issue title and description
3. **Select agents**: Based on issue labels and content
4. **Conduct deep analysis**:
   - Technical approach recommendations
   - Architecture considerations
   - Implementation steps breakdown
   - Effort and complexity assessment
   - Risk analysis
   - Success criteria definition
5. **Post to GitHub**: Add findings as issue comment
6. **Update labels**: Add technical labels if missing (e.g., 'architecture', 'complex')
7. **Terminal summary**: Show what was added

**Response Format**:
```

## Integration with ADLC Workflow

```
💭 Brainstorm idea
    ↓
🔬 /research "topic" → Deep analysis
    ↓ Decision point
💡 /idea "topic" → Create issue (or captured during research)
    ↓
🗺️ Use GitHub for prioritization
    ↓
🔬 /research <issue#> → Technical deep-dive (optional but recommended)
    ↓
🚀 /start <issue#> → Begin development
    ↓
✅ /complete → Finish project
```

## When to Use /research vs /idea

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Quick thought, obvious value | `/idea` directly |
| Complex idea, unclear feasibility | `/research` first, then decide |
| Existing issue needs analysis | `/research <issue#>` |
| Strategic planning session | `/research` multiple topics |
| Before `/start` on complex issue | `/research <issue#>` for prep |

# → Architecture patterns explored
# → Effort estimated
# → "Should I capture this?" → User decides
```

### Example 2: Issue Deep-Dive Before Building
