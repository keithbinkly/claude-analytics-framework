## Grid Dynamics Adoption Framework

**Source:** Grid Dynamics case study (Aiven, Mercado Libre implementations)

### 4-Phase Adoption Model

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goals:**
- Establish governance structure
- Define core business metrics
- Create pilot with analytics team

**Activities:**

1. **Form Metric Council**
   - **Members:** VP Analytics, Data Platform Lead, 3-5 domain experts (finance, product, marketing)
   - **Charter:** Define, approve, and deprecate metrics
   - **Cadence:** Weekly during rollout, monthly ongoing

2. **Identify 10-15 Core Metrics**
   - Start with executive dashboard KPIs
   - **Examples:** Total Revenue, Active Users, Conversion Rate, Churn Rate
   - Document business logic and edge cases

3. **Build Pilot Semantic Models**
   ```yaml
   # Core entity: users
   semantic_models:
     - name: users
       model: ref('dim_users')
       # Define user entity, dimensions, measures

   # Core entity: transactions
   semantic_models:
     - name: transactions
       model: ref('fct_transactions')
       # Define transaction metrics
   ```

4. **Validate with Stakeholders**
   - Run pilot queries
   - Compare to legacy reports (target: > 99.9% match)
   - Gather feedback from 5-10 power users

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Metric Council meets weekly
- ✅ 10-15 core metrics defined and validated
- ✅ 5 power users trained and providing feedback

---

#### Phase 2: Expand (Weeks 5-12)

**Goals:**
- Scale to 50-100 metrics
- Onboard 3-5 teams
- Integrate with primary BI tool

**Activities:**

1. **Federated Metric Ownership**
   - **Finance team** → Revenue, cost, margin metrics
   - **Product team** → Activation, engagement, retention metrics
   - **Marketing team** → Acquisition, campaign, attribution metrics

   **Ownership model:**
   ```yaml
   metrics:
     - name: total_revenue
       owner: finance-team
       config:
         meta:
           owner_email: finance-data@company.com
           sla: 99.9%
           refresh_frequency: hourly
   ```

2. **Create Metric Catalog**
   - Use dbt Docs or dedicated catalog tool
   - Include: Name, owner, business logic, example queries
   - Make searchable by domain (finance, product, marketing)

3. **BI Tool Integration**
   - Connect Tableau/Looker/Mode to Semantic Layer
   - Migrate 20-30% of dashboards
   - Run parallel dashboards (legacy vs. Semantic Layer)

4. **Establish SLAs**
   - **Tier 1 (Critical):** < 1s query time, 99.99% uptime
   - **Tier 2 (Important):** < 5s query time, 99.9% uptime
   - **Tier 3 (Standard):** < 15s query time, 99% uptime

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 50-100 metrics in production
- ✅ 3-5 teams owning metrics
- ✅ 20-30% dashboards migrated
- ✅ SLAs defined and monitored

---

#### Phase 3: Standardize (Weeks 13-24)

**Goals:**
- 100% dashboard migration
- Deprecate legacy metric logic
- Establish continuous improvement process

**Activities:**

1. **Metric Certification Program**
   - **Bronze:** Basic validation (compiles, documented)
   - **Silver:** Stakeholder reviewed, unit tested
   - **Gold:** Executive-approved, SLA monitored

   **Example:**
   ```yaml
   metrics:
     - name: net_revenue
       meta:
         certification: gold
         certified_by: cfo@company.com
         certified_date: 2024-11-01
         review_frequency: quarterly
   ```

2. **Deprecate Legacy Logic**
   - Identify duplicate metric calculations (SQL snippets, BI tool calcs)
   - Replace with Semantic Layer metrics
   - Archive legacy code (don't delete, keep for audit)

3. **Version Control Metrics**
   - Use Git for all metric definitions
   - Require PR reviews for metric changes
   - Tag releases (e.g., `metrics-v1.2.0`)

4. **Monitor Adoption Metrics**
   - **% Queries via Semantic Layer** (target: > 90%)
   - **% Certified Metrics** (target: > 80%)
   - **Mean Time to Metric Creation** (target: < 2 days)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 100% dashboards migrated
- ✅ 80%+ metrics certified
- ✅ < 10% queries bypass Semantic Layer

---

#### Phase 4: Scale (Ongoing)

**Goals:**
- Self-service metric creation
- Cross-domain metric reuse
- Proactive metric health monitoring

**Activities:**

1. **Self-Service Metric Studio**
   - Provide templates for common metric patterns
   - Enable analysts to submit metric PRs (reviewed by Metric Council)
   - Automate validation (CI/CD checks)

2. **Metric Lineage Tracking**
   - Use dbt Docs or third-party tools (Atlan, Collibra)
   - Visualize metric → semantic model → dbt model → source table
   - Enable impact analysis ("What breaks if I change this source?")

3. **Proactive Alerting**
   - Monitor metric freshness (SLA: Data < 24 hours old)
   - Detect anomalies (e.g., revenue drops 50% overnight)
   - Alert metric owners automatically

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ > 50% metrics created by domain teams (not central data team)
- ✅ Metric lineage visible for all certified metrics
- ✅ Zero surprise metric failures (proactive alerts)

---

## Governance Models

### Model 1: Centralized Governance (Small orgs, < 500 employees)

**Structure:**
- **Central Data Team** owns all metric definitions
- **Domain Teams** request metrics via tickets
- **Approval:** Data team reviews and implements

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent quality (single team controls standards)
- ✅ Easier to enforce best practices
- ✅ Lower risk of metric proliferation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Bottleneck (data team capacity-limited)
- ❌ Slower time to metric creation
- ❌ Domain teams less engaged

**When to use:** Early adoption, small analytics team, high quality requirements

---

### Model 2: Federated Governance (Large orgs, 500+ employees)

**Structure:**
- **Domain Teams** own metrics for their areas (finance, product, marketing)
- **Metric Council** sets standards and reviews cross-domain metrics
- **Central Data Team** provides platform and tooling

**Pros:**
- ✅ Scalable (domain expertise embedded)
- ✅ Faster metric creation
- ✅ Higher domain team engagement

**Cons:**
- ❌ Risk of inconsistency (different teams, different standards)
- ❌ Requires coordination (Metric Council meetings)
- ❌ Potential metric duplication

**When to use:** Large org, mature analytics practice, domain-specific needs

---

### Model 3: Hybrid Governance

**Structure:**
- **Core Metrics (Tier 1)** - Centralized (finance, revenue, users)
- **Domain Metrics (Tier 2)** - Federated (product features, marketing campaigns)
- **Exploratory Metrics (Tier 3)** - Self-service (analysts, no approval needed)

**Decision Matrix:**

| Metric Type | Owner | Approval | Example |
|-------------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Executive Dashboard** | Central Data | Metric Council | Total Revenue, Active Users |
| **Board Metrics** | Finance/Central | CFO + Metric Council | GAAP Revenue, Net Income |
| **Domain KPIs** | Domain Team | Domain Lead | Feature Adoption, Email CTR |
| **Exploratory** | Analyst | None (self-service) | Cohort-specific retention |

---

## Change Management Strategies

### Strategy 1: "Show, Don't Tell"

**Approach:**
- Build side-by-side dashboards (legacy vs. Semantic Layer)
- Invite stakeholders to compare
- Highlight new capabilities (slice by new dimensions, faster queries)

**Example Communication:**
> "We've rebuilt the Executive Dashboard using the Semantic Layer. Both versions show the same data, but the new one lets you filter by customer segment, product category, and region—all without waiting for us to build new tables. Try it out and let us know what you think."

---

### Strategy 2: "Carrot and Stick"

**Carrot (Incentives):**
- Faster query responses (Semantic Layer optimized)
- Self-service slicing (no SQL required)
- Always up-to-date (refreshes automatically)

**Stick (Deprecation Timeline):**
- **Month 1-2:** Announce legacy dashboard deprecation (6-month sunset)
- **Month 3-4:** Run parallel dashboards
- **Month 5-6:** Disable edit access to legacy dashboards (read-only)
- **Month 7:** Delete legacy dashboards

**Communication Template:**
> "Legacy dashboards will be read-only on [date]. To make changes, migrate to the Semantic Layer. Need help? Book office hours with the data team."

---

### Strategy 3: "Train the Trainers"

**Approach:**
1. Identify 5-10 "champions" per domain (finance, product, marketing)
2. Train champions on Semantic Layer (2-hour workshop)
3. Champions train their teams (peer-to-peer learning)
4. Champions provide feedback to Metric Council

**Workshop Agenda:**
- Hour 1: Semantic Layer concepts (metrics, dimensions, entities)
- Hour 2: Hands-on practice (query metrics in BI tool, create saved queries)

---

## Organizational Alignment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Executive Sponsorship

**Why:** Semantic Layer adoption is a cultural shift, not just a tech project

**How:**
1. Present to executive team (CFO, CPO, CMO)
2. Show ROI: Faster insights, fewer metric discrepancies, self-service analytics
3. Get executive to sponsor (e.g., CFO mandates all finance metrics via Semantic Layer)

**Example ROI Metrics:**
- **Time saved:** 20 hours/week (no more ad hoc metric queries)
- **Cost saved:** $50k/year (reduce BI tool licenses by enabling self-service)
- **Quality improved:** 99.9% metric accuracy (was 90% with scattered SQL)

---

### Pattern 2: Metrics as Product

**Mindset Shift:**
- Treat metrics like software products
- **Users:** Analysts, execs, domain teams
- **Features:** New metrics, improved performance, better documentation
- **Roadmap:** Quarterly metric releases

**Product Management Approach:**
1. **Backlog:** Track metric requests (Jira, Linear, etc.)
2. **Prioritization:** Impact vs. effort (use RICE scoring)
3. **Releases:** Bundle 10-15 new metrics per quarter
4. **Retrospectives:** Gather feedback, iterate

---

### Pattern 3: Metric Ownership SLAs

**Define ownership responsibilities:**

| Responsibility | Owner | SLA |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| **Metric logic accuracy** | Domain team | 99.9% correct |
| **Documentation completeness** | Domain team | 100% metrics documented |
| **Query performance** | Data platform team | < 5s for dashboards |
| **Uptime** | Data platform team | 99.9% |
| **Incident response** | Shared (on-call rotation) | Acknowledge < 15 min |

**Enforcement:**
- Monthly metric health reports
- Escalate to Metric Council if SLAs missed
- Deprecate metrics with repeated failures

---

## Metric Catalog Best Practices

### Catalog Structure

**Hierarchy:**
```
Domain (Finance, Product, Marketing)
  ├── Subdomain (Revenue, Costs, Margins)
  │   ├── Metric (Total Revenue)
  │   │   ├── Business Logic
  │   │   ├── Example Queries
  │   │   ├── Owner
  │   │   ├── SLA
  │   │   └── Changelog
```

### Metadata to Track

**Required:**
- Name, description, owner
- Business logic (plain English)
- Technical definition (YAML)
- Example queries

**Optional:**
- Related metrics (e.g., "See also: Net Revenue, Gross Revenue")
- Known limitations (e.g., "Excludes refunds before 2023")
- SLA tier (Tier 1/2/3)
- Certification level (Bronze/Silver/Gold)

**Example:**
```yaml
metrics:
  - name: total_revenue
    description: Sum of all completed order revenue, excluding refunds
    label: Total Revenue
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: revenue
    filter: |
      {{ Dimension('order__order_status') }} = 'completed'
    config:
      meta:
        owner: finance-team
        owner_email: finance-data@company.com
        sla_tier: 1
        certification: gold
        business_logic: |
          Revenue recognized when order status = 'completed'.
          Excludes refunds (handled separately in refund_amount metric).
          Updated hourly from transactional database.
        example_queries:
          - "Total revenue by month: mf query --metrics total_revenue --group-by metric_time__month"
          - "Revenue by segment: mf query --metrics total_revenue --group-by customer__segment"
        changelog:
          - date: 2024-11-01
            change: "Added filter for completed orders only"
            author: alice@company.com
```

## Common Enterprise Challenges

### Challenge 1: Metric Proliferation

**Symptom:** 500+ metrics, most unused

**Causes:**
- No deprecation process
- Easy to create, hard to delete
- Lack of discoverability (analysts recreate instead of reuse)

**Solutions:**
1. **Metric Health Scores:**
   - Track query frequency (last 30 days)
   - Flag metrics with 0 queries
   - Auto-archive after 90 days unused

2. **Metric Reviews:**
   - Quarterly review by Metric Council
   - Deprecate redundant metrics
   - Consolidate similar metrics

3. **Discoverability:**
   - Improve catalog search (tags, synonyms)
   - Suggest related metrics ("Users also queried...")

---

### Challenge 2: Conflicting Metric Definitions

**Symptom:** Finance's "revenue" ≠ Product's "revenue"

**Causes:**
- Different business logic (GAAP vs. non-GAAP)
- Different filters (completed orders vs. all orders)
- Siloed metric creation

**Solutions:**
1. **Naming Conventions:**
   - `gaap_revenue` vs. `product_revenue`
   - Disambiguate with prefixes/suffixes

2. **Metric Council Review:**
   - Require cross-domain approval for overlapping metrics
   - Document differences explicitly

3. **Canonical Metrics:**
   - Define "source of truth" version
   - Derive other versions from canonical
   ```yaml
   metrics:
     - name: total_revenue_canonical
       # Source of truth

     - name: gaap_revenue
       type: derived
       type_params:
         expr: total_revenue_canonical  # Apply GAAP adjustments
   ```

---

### Challenge 3: Performance at Scale

**Symptom:** Queries slow with 1000+ metrics, 100+ dimensions

**Causes:**
- Too many joins in semantic graph
- Unoptimized warehouse tables
- Inefficient query patterns

**Solutions:**
1. **Optimize Base Models:**
   - Add DISTKEY/SORTKEY (Redshift)
   - Partition tables (BigQuery, Snowflake)
   - See [Redshift Optimization Guide](../../dbt-redshift-optimization/SKILL.md)

2. **Limit Semantic Graph Complexity:**
   - Max 5-7 entities in single query
   - Use saved queries to pre-define common joins

3. **Cache Frequently-Used Queries:**
   - Materialize saved queries as tables (for dashboards)
   - Refresh on schedule (hourly, daily)
