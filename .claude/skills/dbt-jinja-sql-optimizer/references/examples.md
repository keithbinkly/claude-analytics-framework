**Contents:**
- SQL Style
- Model Organization
- Model Layers
- Model File Naming and Coding
- Model Configurations
- Testing

  - Set up the dbt Semantic Layer

- Use lowercase keywords.
- Use trailing commas.

## Model Organization

Our models (typically) fit into two main categories:\

- Staging &mdash; Contains models that clean and standardize data.        
- Marts &mdash; Contains models which combine or heavily transform data.

- There are different types of models that typically exist in each of the above categories. See Model Layers for more information.
- Read How we structure our dbt projects for an example and more details around organization.

- Only models in `staging` should select from sources.
- Models not in the `staging` folder should select from refs.

## Model File Naming and Coding

- All objects should be plural.  
  Example: `stg_stripe__invoices.sql` vs. `stg_stripe__invoice.sql`

- All models should use the naming convention `<type/dag_stage>_<source/topic>__<additional_context>`. See this article for more information.

- Models in the **staging** folder should use the source's name as the `<source/topic>` and the entity name as the `additional_context`.

- seed_snowflake_spend.csv
    - base_stripe\_\_invoices.sql
    - stg_stripe\_\_customers.sql
    - stg_salesforce\_\_customers.sql
    - int_customers\_\_unioned.sql
    - fct_orders.sql

- Schema, table, and column names should be in `snake_case`.

- Limit the use of abbreviations that are related to domain knowledge. An onboarding employee will understand `current_order_status` better than `current_os`.

- Use names based on the _business_ rather than the source terminology.

- Each model should have a primary key to identify the unique row and should be named `<object>_id`. For example, `account_id`. This makes it easier to know what `id` is referenced in downstream joined models.

- For `base` or `staging` models, columns should be ordered in categories, where identifiers are first and date/time fields are at the end.
- Date/time columns should be named according to these conventions:

- Timestamps: `<event>_at`  
    Format: UTC  
    Example: `created_at`

- Dates: `<event>_date`
    Format: Date  
    Example: `created_date`

- Booleans should be prefixed with `is_` or `has_`.
  Example: `is_active_customer` and `has_admin_access`

- Price/revenue fields should be in decimal currency (for example, `19.99` for $19.99; many app databases store prices as integers in cents). If a non-decimal currency is used, indicate this with suffixes. For example, `price_in_cents`.

- Avoid using reserved words (such as these for Snowflake) as column names.

- Consistency is key! Use the same field names across models where possible. For example, a key to the `customers` table should be named `customer_id` rather than `user_id`.

## Model Configurations

- Model configurations at the folder level should be considered (and if applicable, applied) first.
- More specific configurations should be applied at the model level using one of these methods.
- Models within the `marts` folder should be materialized as `table` or `incremental`.
  - By default, `marts` should be materialized as `table` within `dbt_project.yml`.
  - If switching to `incremental`, this should be specified in the model's configuration.

- At a minimum, `unique` and `not_null` tests should be applied to the expected primary key of each model.

For more information about why we use so many CTEs, read this glossary entry.

- Where performance permits, CTEs should perform a single, logical unit of work.
- CTE names should be as verbose as needed to convey what they do.
- CTEs with confusing or noteable logic should be commented with SQL comments as you would with any complex functions and should be located above the CTE.
- CTEs duplicated across models should be pulled out and created as their own models.

### Refactor an existing rollup

#### A new approach[​](#a-new-approach "Direct link to A new approach")

Now that we've set the stage, it's time to dig in to the fun and messy part: how do we refactor an existing rollup in dbt into semantic models and metrics?

Let's look at the differences we can observe in how we might approach this with MetricFlow supercharging dbt versus how we work without a Semantic Layer. These differences can then inform our structure.

* 🍊 In dbt, we tend to create **highly denormalized datasets** that bring **everything you want around a certain entity or process into a single table**.
* 💜 The problem is, this **limits the dimensionality available to MetricFlow**. The more we pre-compute and 'freeze' into place, the less flexible our data is.
* 🚰 In MetricFlow, we ideally want **highly normalized**, star schema-like data that then allows MetricFlow to shine as a **denormalization engine**.
* ∞ Another way to think about this is that instead of moving down a list of requested priorities trying to pre-make as many combinations of our marts as possible — increasing lines of code and complexity — we can **let MetricFlow present every combination possible without specifically coding it**.
* 🏗️ To resolve these approaches optimally, we'll need to shift some **fundamental aspects of our modeling strategy**.

#### Refactor steps outlined[​](#refactor-steps-outlined "Direct link to Refactor steps outlined")

We recommend an incremental implementation process that looks something like this:

1. 👉 Identify **an important output** (a revenue chart on a dashboard for example, and the mart model(s) that supplies this output.
2. 🔍 Examine all the **entities that are components** of this rollup (for instance, an `active_customers_per_week` rollup may include customers, shipping, and product data).
3. 🛠️ **Build semantic models** for all the underlying component marts.
4. 📏 **Build metrics** for the required aggregations in the rollup.
5. 👯 Create a **clone of the output** on top of the Semantic Layer.
6. 💻 Audit to **ensure you get accurate outputs**.
7. 👉 Identify **any other outputs** that point to the rollup and **move them to the Semantic Layer**.
8. ✌️ Put a **deprecation plan** in place for the now extraneous frozen rollup.

You would then **continue this process** on other outputs and marts moving down a list of **priorities**. Each model as you go along will be faster and easier as you'll **reuse many of the same components** that will already have been semantically modeled.

#### Let's make a `revenue` metric[​](#lets-make-a-revenue-metric "Direct link to lets-make-a-revenue-metric")

So far we've been working in new pointing at a staging model to simplify things as we build new mental models for MetricFlow. In reality, unless you're implementing MetricFlow in a green-field dbt project, you probably are going to have some refactoring to do. So let's get into that in detail.

1. 📚 Per the above steps, let's say we've identified our target as a revenue rollup that is built on top of `orders` and `order_items`. Now we need to identify all the underlying components, these will be all the 'import' CTEs at the top of these marts. So in the Jaffle Shop project we'd need: `orders`, `order_items`, `products`, `locations`, and `supplies`.

2. 🗺️ We'll next make semantic models for all of these. Let's walk through a straightforward conversion first with `locations`.

3. ⛓️ We'll want to first decide if we need to do any joining to get this into the shape we want for our semantic model. The biggest determinants of this are two factors:

   <!-- -->

   * 📏 Does this semantic model **contain measures**?
   * 🕥 Does this semantic model have a **primary timestamp**?
   * 🫂 If a semantic model **has measures but no timestamp** (for example, supplies in the example project, which has static costs of supplies), you'll likely want to **sacrifice some normalization and join it on to another model** that has a primary timestamp to allow for metric aggregation.

4. 🔄 If we *don't* need any joins, we'll just go straight to the staging model for our semantic model's `ref`. Locations does have a `tax_rate` measure, but it also has an `ordered_at` timestamp, so we can go **straight to the staging model** here.

5. 🥇 We specify our **primary entity** (based on `location_id`), dimensions (one categorical, `location_name`, and one **primary time dimension** `opened_at`), and lastly our measures, in this case just `average_tax_rate`.

models/marts/locations.yml
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
#### Semantic and logical interaction[​](#semantic-and-logical-interaction "Direct link to Semantic and logical interaction")

Now, let's tackle a thornier situation. Products and supplies both have dimensions and measures but no time dimension. Products has a one-to-one relationship with `order_items`, enriching that table, which is itself just a mapping table of products to orders. Additionally, products have a one-to-many relationship with supplies. The high-level ERD looks like the diagram below.

[![](/img/best-practices/semantic-layer/orders_erd.png?v=2)](#)

So to calculate, for instance, the cost of ingredients and supplies for a given order, we'll need to do some joining and aggregating, but again we **lack a time dimension for products and supplies**. This is the signal to us that we'll **need to build a logical mart** and point our semantic model at that.

tip

**dbt 🧡 MetricFlow.** This is where integrating your semantic definitions into your dbt project really starts to pay dividends. The interaction between the logical and semantic layers is so dynamic, you either need to house them in one codebase or facilitate a lot of cross-project communication and dependency.

1. 🎯 Let's aim at, to start, building a table at the `order_items` grain. We can aggregate supply costs up, map over the fields we want from products, such as price, and bring the `ordered_at` timestamp we need over from the orders table. You can see example code, copied below, in `models/marts/order_items.sql`.

models/marts/order\_items.sql
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
2. 🏗️ Now we've got a table that looks more like what we want to feed into the Semantic Layer. Next, we'll **build a semantic model on top of this new mart** in `models/marts/order_items.yml`. Again, we'll identify our **entities, then dimensions, then measures**.

models/marts/order\_items.yml
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
3. 📏 Finally, Let's **build a simple revenue metric** on top of our semantic model now.

models/marts/order\_items.yml
```

tip

The `owner` key is flexible and accepts arbitrary inputs in addition to the required `email` field. For example, you could include a custom field like `favorite_food` to add context about the team.

#### Attach groups to models[​](#attach-groups-to-models "Direct link to Attach groups to models")

Attach groups to models as you would any other config, in either the `dbt_project.yml` or `whatever.yml` files. For example:

models/marts.yml
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
By assigning groups in the `dbt_project.yml` file, you can capture all models in a subdirectory at once.

In this example, model notifications related to staging models go to the data engineering group, `marts/sales` models to the finance team, and `marts/campaigns` models to the marketing team.

dbt\_project.yml
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
Attaching a group to a model also encompasses its tests, so you will also receive notifications for a model's test failures.

#### Enable access to model notifications[​](#enable-access-to-model-notifications "Direct link to Enable access to model notifications")

Provide dbt account members the ability to configure and receive alerts about issues with models or tests that are encountered during job runs.

To use model-level notifications, your dbt account must have access to the feature. Ask your dbt administrator to enable this feature for account members by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **Notification settings** from your profile name in the sidebar (lower left-hand side).
2. From **Email notifications**, enable the setting **Enable group/owner notifications on models** under the **Model notifications** section. Then, specify which statuses to receive notifications about (Success, Warning, and/or Fails).

### Model query history EnterpriseEnterprise +

### Model query history [Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

Model query history helps data teams track model usage by analyzing query logs.

Model query history allows you to:

* View the count of consumption queries for a model based on the data warehouse's query logs.
* Provides data teams insight, so they can focus their time and infrastructure spend on the worthwhile used data products.
* Enable analysts to find the most popular models used by other people.

Model query history is powered by a single consumption query of the query log table in your data warehouse aggregated on a daily basis.

 What is a consumption query?

Consumption query is a metric of queries in your dbt project that has used the model in a given time. It filters down to `select` statements only to gauge model consumption and excludes dbt model build and test executions.

So for example, if `model_super_santi` was queried 10 times in the past week, it would count as having 10 consumption queries for that particular time period.

Support for Snowflake (Enterprise tier or higher) and BigQuery

Model query history for Snowflake users is **only available for Enterprise tier or higher**. The feature also supports BigQuery. Additional platforms coming soon.

#### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To access the features, you should meet the following:

1. You have a dbt account on an [Enterprise-tier plan](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/). Single-tenant accounts should contact their account representative for setup.
2. You have set up a [production](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-environments.md#set-as-production-environment) deployment environment for each project you want to explore, with at least one successful job run.
3. You have [admin permissions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md) in dbt to edit project settings or production environment settings.
4. Use Snowflake or BigQuery as your data warehouse and can enable [query history permissions](#snowflake-model-query-history) or work with an admin to do so. Support for additional data platforms coming soon.
   <!-- -->
   * For Snowflake users: You **must** have a Snowflake Enterprise tier or higher subscription.

#### Enable query history in dbt[​](#enable-query-history-in-dbt "Direct link to Enable query history in dbt")

To enable model query history in dbt, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Deploy** and then **Environments**.

2. Select the environment marked **PROD** and click **Settings**.

3. Click **Edit** and scroll to the **Query History** section to enable the query history toggle. When it’s green and to the right, it's enabled.

4. Click the **Test Permissions** button to validate the deployment credentials permissions are sufficient to support query history.

5. dbt automatically enables query history for brand new environments. If query history fails to retrieve data, dbt automatically disables it to prevent unintended warehouse costs.

   <!-- -->

   * If the failure is temporary (like a network timeout), dbt may retry.
   * If the issue is permanent (like a missing permissions), dbt disables query history immediately.

   <!-- -->

   To re-enable it, please reach out to [dbt Support](mailto:support@getdbt.com).

[![Example of permissions verified result after clicking Test Permissions.](/img/docs/collaborate/dbt-explorer/enable-query-history-success.jpg?v=2 "Example of permissions verified result after clicking Test Permissions.")](#)Example of permissions verified result after clicking Test Permissions.

#### Credential permissions[​](#credential-permissions "Direct link to Credential permissions")

This section explains the permissions and steps you need to enable and view model query history in Catalog.

The model query history feature uses the credentials in your production environment to gather metadata from your data warehouse’s query logs. This means you may need elevated permissions with the warehouse. Before making any changes to your data platform permissions, confirm the configured permissions in dbt:

1. Navigate to **Deploy** and then **Environments**.
2. Select the Environment marked **PROD** and click **Settings**.
3. Look at the information under **Deployment credentials**.
   <!-- -->
   * Note: Querying query history entails warehouse costs / uses credits.

[![Confirm your deployment credentials in your environment settings page.](/img/docs/collaborate/dbt-explorer/model-query-credentials.jpg?v=2 "Confirm your deployment credentials in your environment settings page.")](#)Confirm your deployment credentials in your environment settings page.

4. Copy or cross reference those credential permissions with the warehouse permissions and grant your user the right permissions.

###### Snowflake model query history[​](#snowflake-model-query-history "Direct link to Snowflake model query history")

Model query history makes use of metadata tables available to [Snowflake Enterprise tier](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions#enterprise-edition) accounts or higher, `QUERY_HISTORY` and `ACCESS_HISTORY`. The Snowflake user in the production environment must have the `GOVERNANCE_VIEWER` permission to view the data. Before enabling Model query history, your `ACCOUNTADMIN` must run the following grant statement in Snowflake to ensure for access:
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
Without this grant, model query history won't display any data. For more details, view the snowflake docs [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage#enabling-other-roles-to-use-schemas-in-the-snowflake-database).

###### BigQuery model query history[​](#bigquery-model-query-history "Direct link to BigQuery model query history")

Model query history uses the metadata from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` view in BigQuery. To access this, the user configured for your production environment must have the following [IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control) for your BigQuery project:

* `roles/bigquery.resourceViewer`
* `roles/bigquery.jobs.create`

#### View query history in Explorer[​](#view-query-history-in-explorer "Direct link to View query history in Explorer")

To enhance your discovery, you can view your model query history in various locations within Catalog:

### Model versions

Model versions, dbt\_project.yml versions, and .yml versions

Take note that [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions.md) are different from [dbt\_project.yml versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/version.md#dbt_projectyml-versions) and [.yml property file versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/version.md#yml-property-file-versions).

Model versions is a *feature* that enables better governance and data model management by allowing you to track changes and updates to models over time. dbt\_project.yml versions refer to the compatibility of the dbt project with a specific version of dbt. Version numbers within .yml property files inform how dbt parses those YAML files. The latter two are completely optional starting from dbt v1.5.

Versioning APIs is a hard problem in software engineering. The root of the challenge is that the producers and consumers of an API have competing incentives:

* Producers of an API need the ability to modify its logic and structure. There is a real cost to maintaining legacy endpoints forever, but losing the trust of downstream users is far costlier.
* Consumers of an API need to trust in its stability: their queries will keep working, and won't break without warning. Although migrating to a newer API version incurs an expense, an unplanned migration is far costlier.

When sharing a final dbt model with other teams or systems, that model is operating like an API. When the producer of that model needs to make significant changes, how can they avoid breaking the queries of its users downstream?

Model versioning is a tool to tackle this problem, thoughtfully and head-on. The goal is not to make the problem go away entirely, nor to pretend it's easier or simpler than it is.

###### Considerations[​](#considerations "Direct link to Considerations")

There are some considerations to keep in mind when using model governance features:

* Model governance features like model access, contracts, and versions strengthen trust and stability in your dbt project. Because they add structure, they can make rollbacks harder (for example, removing model access) and increase maintenance if adopted too early. Before adding governance features, consider whether your dbt project is ready to benefit from them. Introducing governance while models are still changing can complicate future changes.

* Governance features are model-specific. They don't apply to other resource types, including snapshots, seeds, or sources. This is because these objects can change structure over time (for example, snapshots capture evolving historical data) and aren't suited to guarantees like contracts, access, or versioning.

#### Related documentation[​](#related-documentation "Direct link to Related documentation")

* [`versions`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions.md)
* [`latest_version`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/latest_version.md)
* [`include` and `exclude`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions.md#include)
* [`ref` with `version` argument](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref.md#versioned-ref)

#### Why version a model?[​](#why-version-a-model "Direct link to Why version a model?")

If a model defines a ["contract"](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts.md) (a set of guarantees for its structure), it's also possible to change that model's structure in a way that breaks the previous set of guarantees. This could be as obvious as removing or renaming a column, or more subtle, like changing its data type or nullability.

One approach is to force every model consumer to immediately handle the breaking change as soon as it's deployed to production. This is actually the appropriate answer at many smaller organizations, or while rapidly iterating on a not-yet-mature set of data models. But it doesn’t scale well beyond that.

Instead, for mature models at larger organizations, powering queries inside & outside dbt, the model owner can use **model versions** to:

* Test "prerelease" changes (in production, in downstream systems)
* Bump the latest version, to be used as the canonical source of truth
* Offer a migration window off the "old" version

During that migration window, anywhere that model is being used downstream, it can continue to be referenced at a specific version.

dbt Core 1.6 introduced first-class support for **deprecating models** by specifying a [`deprecation_date`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/deprecation_date.md). Taken together, model versions and deprecation offer a pathway for model producers to *sunset* old models, and consumers the time to *migrate* across breaking changes. It's a way of managing change across an organization: develop a new version, bump the latest, slate the old version for deprecation, update downstream references, and then remove the old version.

There is a real trade-off that exists here—the cost to frequently migrate downstream code, and the cost (and clutter) of materializing multiple versions of a model in the data warehouse. Model versions do not make that problem go away, but by setting a deprecation date, and communicating a clear window for consumers to gracefully migrate off old versions, they put a known boundary on the cost of that migration.

#### When should you version a model?[​](#when-should-you-version-a-model "Direct link to When should you version a model?")

By enforcing a model's contract, dbt can help you catch unintended changes to column names and data types that could cause a big headache for downstream queriers. If you're making these changes intentionally, you should create a new model version. If you're making a non-breaking change, you don't need a new version—such as adding a new column, or fixing a bug in an existing column's calculation.

Of course, it's possible to change a model's definition in other ways—recalculating a column in a way that doesn't change its name, data type, or enforceable characteristics—but would substantially change the results seen by downstream queriers.

This is always a judgment call. As the maintainer of a widely-used model, you know best what's a bug fix and what's an unexpected behavior change.

The process of sunsetting and migrating model versions requires real work, and likely significant coordination across teams. You should opt for non-breaking changes whenever possible. Inevitably, however, these non-breaking additions will leave your most important models with lots of unused or deprecated columns.

Rather than constantly adding a new version for each small change, you should opt for a predictable cadence (once or twice a year, communicated well in advance) where you bump the "latest" version of your model, removing columns that are no longer being used.

#### How is this different from "version control"?[​](#how-is-this-different-from-version-control "Direct link to How is this different from \"version control\"?")

[Version control](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/git-version-control.md) allows your team to collaborate simultaneously on a single code repository, manage conflicts between changes, and review changes before deploying into production. In that sense, version control is an essential tool for versioning the deployment of an entire dbt project—always the latest state of the `main` branch. In general, only one version of your project code is deployed into an environment at a time. If something goes wrong, you have the ability to roll back changes by reverting a commit or pull request, or by leveraging data platform capabilities around "time travel."

When you make updates to a model's source code — its logical definition, in SQL or Python, or related configuration — dbt can [compare your project to the previous state](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax.md#about-node-selection), enabling you to rebuild only models that have changed, and models downstream of a change. In this way, it's possible to develop changes to a model, quickly test in CI, and efficiently deploy into production — all coordinated via your version control system.

**Versioned models are different.** Defining model `versions` is appropriate when people, systems, and processes beyond your team's control, inside or outside of dbt, depend on your models. You can neither simply go migrate them all, nor break their queries on a whim. You need to offer a migration path, with clear diffs and deprecation dates.

Multiple versions of a model will live in the same code repository at the same time, and be deployed into the same data environment simultaneously. This is similar to how web APIs are versioned: Multiple versions live simultaneously, two or three, and not more). Over time, newer versions come online, and older versions are sunsetted .

#### How is this different from just creating a new model?[​](#how-is-this-different-from-just-creating-a-new-model "Direct link to How is this different from just creating a new model?")

Honestly, it's only a little bit different! There isn't much magic here, and that's by design.

You've always been able to copy-paste, create a new model file, and name it `dim_customers_v2.sql`. Why should you opt for a "real" versioned model instead?

As the **producer** of a versioned model:

* You keep track of all live versions in one place, rather than scattering them throughout the codebase
* You can reuse the model's configuration, and highlight just the diffs between versions
* You can select models to build (or not) based on whether they're a `latest`, `prerelease`, or `old` version
* dbt will notify consumers of your versioned model when new versions become available, or when they are slated for deprecation

As the **consumer** of a versioned model:

* You use a consistent `ref`, with the option of pinning to a specific live version
* You will be notified throughout the life cycle of a versioned model

All versions of a model preserve the model's original name. They are `ref`'d by that name, rather than the name of the file that they're defined in. By default, the `ref` resolves to the latest version (as declared by that model's maintainer), but you can also `ref` a specific version of the model, with a `version` keyword.

Let's say that `dim_customers` has three versions defined: `v2` is the "latest", `v3` is "prerelease," and `v1` is an old version that's still within its deprecation window. Because `v2` is the latest version, it gets some special treatment: it can be defined in a file without a suffix, and `ref('dim_customers')` will resolve to `v2` if a version pin is not specified. The table below breaks down the standard conventions:

| v | version      | `ref` syntax                                               | File name                                         | Database relation                                                            |
| - | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3 | "prerelease" | `ref('dim_customers', v=3)`                                | `dim_customers_v3.sql`                            | `analytics.dim_customers_v3`                                                 |
| 2 | "latest"     | `ref('dim_customers', v=2)` **and** `ref('dim_customers')` | `dim_customers_v2.sql` **or** `dim_customers.sql` | `analytics.dim_customers_v2` **and** `analytics.dim_customers` (recommended) |
| 1 | "old"        | `ref('dim_customers', v=1)`                                | `dim_customers_v1.sql`                            | `analytics.dim_customers_v1`                                                 |

As you'll see in the implementation section below, a versioned model can reuse the majority of its YAML properties and configuration. Each version needs to only say how it *differs* from the shared set of attributes. This gives you, as the producer of a versioned model, the opportunity to highlight the differences across versions—which is otherwise difficult to detect in models with dozens or hundreds of columns—and to clearly track, in one place, all versions of the model which are currently live.

dbt also supports [`version`-based selection](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/methods.md#version). For example, you could define a [default YAML selector](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors.md#default) that avoids running any old model versions in development, even while you continue to run them in production through a sunset and migration period. (You could accomplish something similar by applying `tags` to these models, and cycling through those tags over time.)

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
##### Column API[​](#column-api "Direct link to Column API")

##### Properties[​](#properties "Direct link to Properties")

* **char\_size**: Returns the maximum size for character varying columns
* **column**: Returns the name of the column
* **data\_type**: Returns the data type of the column (with size/precision/scale included)
* **dtype**: Returns the data type of the column (without any size/precision/scale included)
* **name**: Returns the name of the column (identical to `column`, provided as an alias).
* **numeric\_precision**: Returns the maximum precision for fixed decimal columns
* **numeric\_scale**: Returns the maximum scale for fixed decimal columns
* **quoted**: Returns the name of the column wrapped in quotes

##### Instance methods[​](#instance-methods "Direct link to Instance methods")

* **is\_string()**: Returns True if the column is a String type (eg. text, varchar), else False
* **is\_numeric()**: Returns True if the column is a fixed-precision Numeric type (eg. `numeric`), else False
* **is\_number()**: Returns True if the column is a number-y type (eg. `numeric`, `int`, `float`, or similar), else False
* **is\_integer()**: Returns True if the column is an integer (eg. `int`, `bigint`, `serial` or similar), else False
* **is\_float()**: Returns True if the column is a float type (eg. `float`, `float64`, or similar), else False
* **string\_size()**: Returns the width of the column if it is a string type, else, an exception is raised

##### Static methods[​](#static-methods "Direct link to Static methods")

* **string\_type(size)**: Returns a database-useable representation of the string type (eg. `character varying(255)`)
* **numeric\_type(dtype, precision, scale)**: Returns a database-useable representation of the numeric type (eg. `numeric(12, 4)`)

##### Using columns[​](#using-columns "Direct link to Using columns")

column\_usage.sql
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
#### BigQuery columns[​](#bigquery-columns "Direct link to BigQuery columns")

The `Column` type is overridden as a `BigQueryColumn` in BigQuery dbt projects. This object works the same as the `Column` type described above, with the exception of extra properties and methods:

##### Properties[​](#properties-1 "Direct link to Properties")

* **fields**: Returns the list of subfields contained within a field (if the column is a STRUCT)
* **mode**: Returns the "mode" of the column, eg. `REPEATED`

##### Instance methods[​](#instance-methods-1 "Direct link to Instance methods")

**flatten()**: Return a flattened list of `BigQueryColumns` in which subfields are expanded into their own columns. For example, this nested field:
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
will be expanded to:
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
#### Result objects[​](#result-objects "Direct link to Result objects")

The execution of a resource in dbt generates a `Result` object. This object contains information about the executed node, timing, status, and metadata returned by the adapter. At the end of an invocation, dbt records these objects in [`run_results.json`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/run-results-json.md).

* `node`: Full object representation of the dbt resource (model, seed, snapshot, test) executed, including its `unique_id`
* `status`: dbt's interpretation of runtime success, failure, or error
* `thread_id`: Which thread executed this node? E.g. `Thread-1`
* `execution_time`: Total time spent executing this node, measured in seconds.
* `timing`: Array that breaks down execution time into steps (often `compile` + `execute`)
* `message`: How dbt will report this result on the CLI, based on information returned from the database

<!-- -->

* `adapter_response`: Dictionary of metadata returned from the database, which varies by adapter. For example, success `code`, number of `rows_affected`, total `bytes_processed`, and so on. Not applicable for [data tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests.md).

  * `rows_affected` returns the number of rows modified by the last statement executed. In cases where the query's row count can't be determined or isn't applicable (such as when creating a view), a [standard value](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/#rowcount) of `-1` is returned for `rowcount`.

### dbt Command reference

You can run dbt using the following tools:

* In your browser with the [Studio IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud.md)
* On the command line interface using the [Cloud CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation.md) or open-source [dbt Core](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/installation-overview.md).

A key distinction with the tools mentioned, is that Cloud CLI and Studio IDE are designed to support safe parallel execution of dbt commands, leveraging dbt's infrastructure and its comprehensive [features](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/about-cloud/dbt-cloud-features.md). In contrast, dbt Core *doesn't support* safe parallel execution for multiple invocations in the same process. Learn more in the [parallel execution](#parallel-execution) section.

#### Parallel execution[​](#parallel-execution "Direct link to Parallel execution")

dbt allows for concurrent execution of commands, enhancing efficiency without compromising data integrity. This enables you to run multiple commands at the same time. However, it's important to understand which commands can be run in parallel and which can't.

In contrast, [`dbt-core` *doesn't* support](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/programmatic-invocations.md#parallel-execution-not-supported) safe parallel execution for multiple invocations in the same process, and requires users to manage concurrency manually to ensure data integrity and system stability.

To ensure your dbt workflows are both efficient and safe, you can run different types of dbt commands at the same time (in parallel) — for example, `dbt build` (write operation) can safely run alongside `dbt parse` (read operation) at the same time. However, you can't run `dbt build` and `dbt run` (both write operations) at the same time.

dbt commands can be `read` or `write` commands:

| Command type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Example                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Write**    | These commands perform actions that change data or metadata in your data platform.<br /><br />Limited to one invocation at any given time, which prevents any potential conflicts, such as overwriting the same table in your data platform at the same time.                                                              | `dbt build`<br />`dbt run`     |
| **Read**     | These commands involve operations that fetch or read data without making any changes to your data platform.<br /><br />Can have multiple invocations in parallel and aren't limited to one invocation at any given time. This means read commands can run in parallel with other read commands and a single write command. | `dbt parse`<br />`dbt compile` |

#### Available commands[​](#available-commands "Direct link to Available commands")

The following sections outline the commands supported by dbt and their relevant flags. They are available in all tools and all [supported versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/core.md) unless noted otherwise. You can run these commands in your specific tool by prefixing them with `dbt` — for example, to run the `test` command, type `dbt test`.

For information about selecting models on the command line, refer to [Model selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax.md).

Commands with a ('❌') indicate write commands, commands with a ('✅') indicate read commands, and commands with a (N/A) indicate it's not relevant to the parallelization of dbt commands.

info

Some commands are not yet supported in the dbt Fusion Engine or have limited functionality. See the [Fusion supported features](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/fusion/supported-features.md) page for details.

### dbt_project.yml

The dbt\_project.yml file is a required file for all dbt projects. It contains important information that tells dbt how to operate your project.

Every [dbt project](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/projects.md) needs a `dbt_project.yml` file — this is how dbt knows a directory is a dbt project. It also contains important information that tells dbt how to operate your project. It works as follows:

* dbt uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) in a few different places. If you're new to YAML, it would be worth learning how arrays, dictionaries, and strings are represented.

* By default, dbt looks for the `dbt_project.yml` in your current working directory and its parents, but you can set a different directory using the `--project-dir` flag or the `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable.

* Specify your dbt project ID in the `dbt_project.yml` file using `project-id` under the `dbt-cloud` config. Find your project ID in your dbt project URL: For example, in `https://YOUR_ACCESS_URL/11/projects/123456`, the project ID is `123456`.

* Note, you can't set up a "property" in the `dbt_project.yml` file if it's not a config (an example is [macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/macro-properties.md)). This applies to all types of resources. Refer to [Configs and properties](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties.md) for more detail.

#### Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

The following example is a list of all available configurations in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

dbt\_project.yml
```

## Example dbt_project.yml file

**URL:** llms-txt#example-dbt_project.yml-file

name: 'jaffle_shop'
profile: 'jaffle_shop'
...

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
dbt then checks your `profiles.yml` file for a profile with the same name. A profile contains all the details required to connect to your data warehouse.

dbt will search the current working directory for the `profiles.yml` file and will default to the `~/.dbt/` directory if not found.

This file generally lives outside of your dbt project to avoid sensitive credentials being checked in to version control, but `profiles.yml` can be safely checked in when [using environment variables](#advanced-using-environment-variables) to load sensitive credentials.

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml
```

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
To add an additional target (like `prod`) to your existing `profiles.yml`, you can add another entry under the `outputs` key.

#### The `env_var` function[​](#the-env_var-function "Direct link to the-env_var-function")

<!-- -->

The `env_var` function can be used to incorporate environment variables from the system into your dbt project. You can use the `env_var` function in your `profiles.yml` file, the `dbt_project.yml` file, the `sources.yml` file, your `schema.yml` files, and in model `.sql` files. Essentially, `env_var` is available anywhere dbt processes Jinja code.

When used in a `profiles.yml` file (to avoid putting credentials on a server), it can be used like this:

profiles.yml
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
#### About the `profiles.yml` file[​](#about-the-profilesyml-file "Direct link to about-the-profilesyml-file")

In your `profiles.yml` file, you can store as many profiles as you need. Typically, you would have one profile for each warehouse you use. Most organizations only have one profile.

#### About profiles[​](#about-profiles "Direct link to About profiles")

A profile consists of *targets*, and a specified *default target*.

Each *target* specifies the type of warehouse you are connecting to, the credentials to connect to the warehouse, and some dbt-specific configurations.

The credentials you need to provide in your target varies across warehouses — sample profiles for each supported warehouse are available in the [Supported Data Platforms](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms.md) section.

**Pro Tip:** You may need to surround your password in quotes if it contains special characters. More details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37015689/10415173).

#### Setting up your profile[​](#setting-up-your-profile "Direct link to Setting up your profile")

To set up your profile, copy the correct sample profile for your warehouse into your `profiles.yml` file and update the details as follows:

* Profile name: Replace the name of the profile with a sensible name – it’s often a good idea to use the name of your organization. Make sure that this is the same name as the `profile` indicated in your `dbt_project.yml` file.

* `target`: This is the default target your dbt project will use. It must be one of the targets you define in your profile. Commonly it is set to `dev`.

* Populating your target:

  <!-- -->

  * `type`: The type of data warehouse you are connecting to
  * Warehouse credentials: Get these from your database administrator if you don’t already have them. Remember that user credentials are very sensitive information that should not be shared.
  * `schema`: The default schema that dbt will build objects in.
  * `threads`: The number of threads the dbt project will run on.

You can find more information on which values to use in your targets below.

Use the [debug](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/debug-method.md) command to validate your warehouse connection. Run `dbt debug` from within a dbt project to test your connection.

#### Understanding targets in profiles[​](#understanding-targets-in-profiles "Direct link to Understanding targets in profiles")

dbt supports multiple targets within one profile to encourage the use of separate development and production environments as discussed in [dbt environments](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/dbt-core-environments.md).

A typical profile for an analyst using dbt locally will have a target named `dev`, and have this set as the default.

You may also have a `prod` target within your profile, which creates the objects in your production schema. However, since it's often desirable to perform production runs on a schedule, we recommend deploying your dbt project to a separate machine other than your local machine. Most dbt users only have a `dev` target in their profile on their local machine.

If you do have multiple targets in your profile, and want to use a target other than the default, you can do this using the `--target` option when issuing a dbt command.

##### Overriding profiles and targets[​](#overriding-profiles-and-targets "Direct link to Overriding profiles and targets")

When running dbt commands, you can specify which profile and target to use from the CLI using the `--profile` and `--target` [flags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs.md#available-flags). These flags override what’s defined in your `dbt_project.yml` as long as the specified profile and target are already defined in your `profiles.yml` file.

To run your dbt project with a different profile or target than the default, you can do so using the followingCLI flags:

* `--profile` flag — Overrides the profile set in `dbt_project.yml` by pointing to another profile defined in `profiles.yml`.
* `--target` flag — Specifies the target within that profile to use (as defined in `profiles.yml`).

These flags help when you're working with multiple profiles and targets and want to override defaults without changing your files.
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
In this example, the `dbt run` command will use the `my-profile-name` profile and the `dev` target.

#### Understanding warehouse credentials[​](#understanding-warehouse-credentials "Direct link to Understanding warehouse credentials")

We recommend that each dbt user has their own set of database credentials, including a separate user for production runs of dbt – this helps debug rogue queries, simplifies ownerships of schemas, and improves security.

To ensure the user credentials you use in your target allow dbt to run, you will need to ensure the user has appropriate privileges. While the exact privileges needed varies between data warehouses, at a minimum your user must be able to:

* read source data
* create schemas¹
* read system tables

Running dbt without create schema privileges

If your user is unable to be granted the privilege to create schemas, your dbt runs should instead target an existing schema that your user has permission to create relations within.

#### Understanding target schemas[​](#understanding-target-schemas "Direct link to Understanding target schemas")

The target schema represents the default schema that dbt will build objects into, and is often used as the differentiator between separate environments within a warehouse.

Schemas in BigQuery

dbt uses the term "schema" in a target across all supported warehouses for consistency. Note that in the case of BigQuery, a schema is actually a dataset.

The schema used for production should be named in a way that makes it clear that it is ready for end-users to use for analysis – we often name this `analytics`.

In development, a pattern we’ve found to work well is to name the schema in your `dev` target `dbt_<username>`. Suffixing your name to the schema enables multiple users to develop in dbt, since each user will have their own separate schema for development, so that users will not build over the top of each other, and ensuring that object ownership and permissions are consistent across an entire schema.

Note that there’s no need to create your target schema beforehand – dbt will check if the schema already exists when it runs, and create it if it doesn’t.

While the target schema represents the default schema that dbt will use, it may make sense to split your models into separate schemas, which can be done by using [custom schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas.md).

#### Understanding threads[​](#understanding-threads "Direct link to Understanding threads")

When dbt runs, it creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of links between models. The number of threads represents the maximum number of paths through the graph dbt may work on at once – increasing the number of threads can minimize the run time of your project. The default value for threads in user profiles is 4 threads.

For more information, check out [using threads](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-threads.md).

#### Advanced: Customizing a profile directory[​](#advanced-customizing-a-profile-directory "Direct link to Advanced: Customizing a profile directory")

The parent directory for `profiles.yml` is determined using the following precedence:

1. `--profiles-dir` option
2. `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` environment variable
3. current working directory
4. `~/.dbt/` directory

To check the expected location of your `profiles.yml` file for your installation of dbt, you can run the following:
```
