## 🎭 Role-Based Agents (Primary Layer)

### Production-Ready Roles
1. **Analytics Engineer** - SQL transformations, dbt modeling, data warehouse optimization
2. **Data Engineer** - Pipeline orchestration (dlthub, Prefect, Airbyte), source integration
3. **BI Developer** - Tableau/Power BI dashboards, enterprise reporting
4. **UI/UX Developer** - Streamlit/React applications, data interfaces
5. **Data Architect** - Platform strategy, system design, technology selection
6. **Business Analyst** - Requirements gathering, stakeholder alignment
7. **QA Engineer** - Testing strategies, data quality validation
8. **Project Manager** - Delivery coordination, UAT frameworks

**Delegation Pattern**: Roles handle 80% independently, delegate to specialists for deep expertise

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1. Cross-System Orchestration
Coordinate work across AWS + Snowflake + dbt + Tableau + GitHub with specialist delegation:
```
Role Agent (e.g., Analytics Engineer)
    ↓ Delegates to specialists when needed
Specialists (dbt-expert, snowflake-expert)
    ↓ Use MCP tools for validated recommendations
Main Claude executes MCP calls + implements recommendations
```

### 2. End-to-End Application Delivery
- **UI/UX Developer** → React/Streamlit development
- **aws-expert** → ECS deployment, ALB configuration, Docker builds
- **github-sleuth-expert** → Issue tracking, PR workflows
- **QA Engineer** → Testing validation

### 3. Production-Validated Patterns
Specialists maintain confidence scores for proven patterns:
- **ALB OIDC Authentication** (confidence: 0.95) - Production-validated
- **ECS Multi-Service Deployment** (confidence: 0.90) - Customer Dashboard app
- **dbt Semantic Layer** (confidence: 0.85) - Analytics engineering

### 4. Knowledge-Driven Decision Making
Three-tier documentation architecture:
- **Tier 1**: Lightweight repo READMEs (developer quick-start)
- **Tier 2**: Comprehensive knowledge base (`knowledge/applications/`)
- **Tier 3**: Agent pattern indexes (confidence + pointers)

### 5. Automated Quality Assurance
- **QA Engineer** delegates to data-quality-specialist
- dbt testing architecture via `dbt-mcp`
- Snowflake validation via `snowflake-mcp`
- GitHub issue creation for tracking

### 6. Cost Optimization
- **cost-optimization-specialist** analyzes Snowflake, AWS, Tableau spending
- Cross-platform recommendations
- Warehouse sizing, compute pool optimization

## 🎯 Current Production Applications

### Known Deployed Systems
1. **Customer Dashboard** (React + FastAPI)
   - ECS deployment, ALB OIDC auth, multi-service Docker
   - Full knowledge base: `knowledge/applications/customer-dashboard/`

2. **App Portal** (React + Node.js)
   - Application launcher, Azure AD integration
   - AWS infrastructure patterns documented

---

## 📊 Workflow Automation

### ADLC Slash Commands
- `/idea` → GitHub issue creation with auto-labeling
- `/research` → Deep exploration and feasibility analysis
- `/roadmap` → Strategic planning from GitHub issues
- `/start` → Project setup with branch management
- `/complete` → Archive + cleanup + learning extraction
- `/switch` → Zero-loss context switching

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Automated error detection → AI investigation → Cross-repo PRs
- dbt test failures → Issue creation → Root cause analysis

---

## 🔒 Security & Governance

### Protected Branch Enforcement
- **NEVER** commit to main/master/production directly
- Feature branch + PR workflow mandatory
- Exception: da-agent-hub documentation only

### Credential Management
- 1Password integration for secrets
- Environment variable references (`${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}`)
- No hardcoded credentials

---

## 💡 Continuous Learning System

### Chat Analysis & Improvement
- Privacy-preserving conversation analysis
- Effectiveness metrics extraction
- Automatic pattern discovery via `/complete`
- Agent capability enhancement recommendations

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Azure Integration**: azure-expert defined but no MCP server yet
2. **Tableau MCP**: Limited functionality compared to other platforms
3. **Orchestra/Prefect MCPs**: Custom implementations, not official
4. **Production Validation**: Some patterns remain confidence <0.80

---

## 📈 Effectiveness Metrics

- **15x Token Cost Justified**: Specialist consultation yields significantly better outcomes (Anthropic research)
- **Correctness > Speed**: Production-ready code on first attempt
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Pattern extraction from every completed project
- **Cross-System Coordination**: Eliminate manual integration work
